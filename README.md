# FullPromise

## TODO

1. [Done] do, doMap, catch, catchMap
1. if promise was fulfilled before appending blocks, still execute them
1. add recovering after errors
1. multiple handlers on one Promise
1. is it worth to organize promise operations as blocks on dispatch queue?
1. add block `always` to execute everytime not depending on state
1. group promises together
